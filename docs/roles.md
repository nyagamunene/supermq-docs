title: Roles, Role Members, and Role Actions
---

## **Roles**

A role is a collection of permissions (actions) that define what members of the role are allowed to do within a specific entity. Each entity (like a `Client`, `Channel`, `Group`, or `Domain`) can have multiple roles, each with its own members and actions.

- **Role Members**: These are users assigned to a role. Members are the only users allowed to perform the role's actions on the entity.
- **Role Actions**: These are permissions defining what members of the role can do. For example, actions can include `read`, `update`, `delete`, or more specific actions like `publish` or `connect_to_channel`. **Refer to `authz-spec.md` for the available actions for each entity type.**

---

## **Base URL**

All API requests use the base URL:  
`http://localhost/<entity_type>/<entity_id>`

Replace `<entity_type>` with one of the entity types (`clients`, `channels`, `groups`, `domains`) and `<entity_id>` with the ID of the specific entity.
